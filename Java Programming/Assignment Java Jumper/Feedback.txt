Code Comments: 
- The placement of { }'s to start and end a block must appear on their own line. Opening braces ({) especially should 
  not be placed on the same line as the header. - ConsoleDisplay -17
- Scanner is not a property of Input class and using as an attribute could lock the console.
- Methods must be sorted alphabetically (except constructors, which always appear first). -main method?
- name is not validated with the blank space
- main should be the starting point of the game rather than holding the logic?
- you are referring to hard coded values - reading of the building should be part of the game.- reusability is not considered
